Summarize the key steps in the deployment process.
    What went well?
        - The entire process went pretty well. I did have some trouble with ALLOWED_HOSTS causing my page to show a 404 error, but that was fixed by adding the name of my app into the ALLOWED_HOSTS array.
    What challenges did you face?
        - Setting up ALLOWED_HOSTS.
    How far did you get?
        - I was able to fully deploy my application with day 4 work completed.

We have utilized docs from several different projects over the course of this Sprint.
Which docs did you think were the most helpful?
    - The docs for whitenoise were extremely useful and easy to setup. The dj_database_url docs were useful but were more confusing to setup.
Name one or two specific things about this resource that you think sets it apart from other docs you have referenced in the past.
    - I liked the whitenoise docs because it was only like one step to get everything setup for the basics, and then there was more if you wanted to get more fancy.
